- Add the facilitycost/time and vesselcost/time multipliers as difficulty settings to the new game options
- Launchpad rework to allow multiple levels
- draining facility cost (continues facility cost during the build)
- mining facility rework to have either a fixed rate or the density
- auto grass color

Some things that I, AMWP, want to do:
- rework the commnet facility and add a kerbal commnet facility
- electricity system (not decided yet how that's done)
- contracts
